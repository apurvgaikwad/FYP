Image and Audio Steganography to Hide Textual Data

Steganography is essentially the art of concealing information. In the field of computer science and security, it refers to hiding data within other non-secret files or data. It serves a similar purpose to cryptography but instead of encrypting data, steganography simply hides it in plain sight. 
Here's a desktop application that helps with image and audio steganography using the LSB Encoding technique.

Just clone the repository and install the necessary python libraries to run the application.
-	eel (for the purpose of message passing between front-end and back-end scripts. More details here->https://pypi.org/project/Eel/)
-	os
-	math
-	struct
-	wave
-	PIL (Python Imaging Library)
